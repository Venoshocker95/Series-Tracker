# Series-Tracker
I've designed a 1980s-style terminal application for managing a list of watched series by using a text-based UI.
Features include:

° Persistent Storage in plain readable form (.txt file),

° Manual memory allocation and struct-based data modeling,

° Keyboard Navigation(no mouse required),

° No GUI, just some simple ASCII banners and ASCII UI design.

This software allows you to: Add, Edit, Remove and View series info.
The program itself needs just a little bit more polishing, but it's absolutely usable as it stands right now.
I hope you'll find it useful or, if you're from the generation that used softwares like this on floppies, that you'll
like the trip down memory lane :)

Tools and resources used:

° "The C Programming Language" by Brian W.Kernighan & Dennis M.Ritchie;

° W3 Schools and Stack Overflow

° Visual Studio Code

° Microsoft Copilot(to help understanding new concepts and to help with the solving of pesky bugs)

KNOWN BUG / PECULIARITIES

Having applied the input fix to avoid input overflow, the user NOW has to push ENTER twice to confirm
(I'VE PROVIDED A NOTE WHILE IN INPUT PHASE TO LET THE USER KNOW)
