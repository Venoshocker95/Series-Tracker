# Series-Tracker
I've designed a 1980s-style terminal application for managing a list of watched series by using a text-based UI.
Features include:

° Persistent Storage in plain readable form (.txt file),

° Manual memory allocation and struct-based data modeling,

° Keyboard Navigation(no mouse required),

° No GUI, just some simple ASCII banners and ASCII UI design.

This software allows you to: Add, Edit, Remove and View series info.
The software needs just a little bit more polishing, but it's absolutely usable as it stands right now.
I hope you'll find it useful or, if you're from the generation that used softwares like this on floppies, that you'll
like the trip down memory lane :)
